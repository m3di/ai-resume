i think i gave you to much mixed information about what i did in each job
you might want to handpick some of those
no need to mention all of them
just pick the right amount according to the job posting
try to understand what is more important to the person who wants to pick a person for this job posting
after doing this maybe you might think not mentioning something might be even better
or maybe rephrase the thing i do to makes it more relevant to new position
but don't do it too much that might look unprofessional

i think the experiences should be right after summary, to the point

add language skills to the last
