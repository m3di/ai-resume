i think i gave you to much mixed information about what i did in each job
you might want to handpick some of those
no need to mention all of them
just pick the right amount according to the job posting
try to understand what is more important to the person who wants to pick a person for this job posting
after doing this maybe you might think not mentioning something might be even better
or maybe rephrase the thing i do to makes it more relevant to new position
but don't do it too much that might look unprofessional

if they want different proggramming language or stack
try to minimize attention to the stack difference
instead use general words to imply that doing the same thing but with other technologies
but don't change the fact that i used something else and be proud about it

i think the experiences should be right after summary, to the point

add language skills to the last

don't be biased by the words or the phrases of the job posting specially with the years of experience
try to calculate my experiance based on my own information
this might increase suspicion about the content being fake or deceptive
instead try to imply it in general
when they read the text they should get a felling that im the exact person that they want

try not to use uncommon or very formal or complex words
keep it simple firm and proffesional
use easy to understand grammer
